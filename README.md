## Project Structure

```
packages/
  core/       - Process manager: spawns & supervises FiveM/RedM
              - Webserver: ElysiaJS API for the panel & game resource communication
  panel-ui/   - React SPA
  database/   - Drizzle schema, migrations, repositories
  resource/   - Drop-in FiveM/RedM Lua resource
shared/
  types/      - Shared TypeScript types
  utils/      - Shared helper functions
```

---

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start system
bun dev
```

The React dev server runs on `:5173` and proxies API/WS calls to Elysia on `:4000`.

---

## Code Quality

```bash
bun check        # lint + format + fix (recommended during dev)
bun lint         # lint only
bun format       # format only
bun typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across all packages (via Turbo)
bun db:studio    # open Drizzle Studio to browse the database (optional)
```

### Adding a migration

Edit `packages/database/src/migrations/index.ts` and append to the array:

```ts
{
  version: 2,
  description: 'Add player notes',
  up: [
    'ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN notes TEXT',
  ],
},
```

Migrations run automatically on next startup. No CLI commands needed.

Biome handles everything ESLint + Prettier would - faster, single config at the root.

---

## Building

```bash
# Build for both platforms
bun run build.ts

# Build for a specific platform
bun run build.ts --target=linux
bun run build.ts --target=windows
```

Turbo caches build outputs - subsequent builds only rebuild what changed.

Output in `dist/`:

```
dist/
  fxmanager-linux          ← Linux binary
  fxmanager-windows.exe    ← Windows binary
  public/                  ← UI assets - must stay next to the binary
  resource/                ← Drop into your server's resources/ folder
```

> ⚠️ The `public/` folder must remain in the same directory as the binary when deploying. The server resolves it relative to its own location at runtime.

---

## Deployment

### 1. Run the binary

```
your-deploy-folder/
  fxmanager-linux      (or fxmanager-windows.exe)
  public/
  .env
```

```bash
./fxmanager-linux    # or fxmanager-windows.exe
```

The panel will be available at `http://your-server-ip:4000`.

### 2. Install the resource

1. Copy `dist/resource/` into your server's `resources/` folder as `fxManager`
2. **IMPORTANT** Add `ensure fxManager` to your `server.cfg`
